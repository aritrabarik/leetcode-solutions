Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 
Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?*/

var twoSum = function (nums, target) {
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] === target) return [i, j];
        }
    }
    return [];
};

/* Explanation:

1. Nested Loops:

- The outer loop iterates through each element.
- The inner loop iterates through the elements following the current element in the outer loop to check all possible pairs.

2. Check Sum:

- For each pair of elements, the sum is checked against the target.
- If the sum equals the target, their indices are returned. */
